# Greylock
Greylock is my custom macropad that I built for fun. Each key and enocder can be programmed to any input or script. 


### Housing
I experimented with different housing shapes and styles. I ended up going with what others have called a "calculator" look. The biggest issue I ran into with the housing was mounting the OLED to the case instead of the board below it. This made it difficult to print a top face that was not too bulky.

### PCB
This was my first go at an SMD PCB. Next time I will try to avoid using the FPC connector I used to connect to the OLED. The pitch on the connector made it a pain to drag solder and took a couple tries. Looking back I also should have done a PCB stack as mountig nthe OLED breakout to the housing was quite a pain to CAD.
